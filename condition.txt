Doing what you want because you can't make everyone happy 
hello every one my name is Pragya Om ,a student of btech from GLA university 
I am here to talk about a topic which very nessacery to talk about but usally no one talk about this thing beacuse they think that if hey talk  about this topic they may be look week 
and in todays era no one wants to look week thats also right because if you look weeek than more people will try to take advantage or try to impose thier things to you 
but some time its importat to talk about the thinks beacuse  its a very old say that if you place a bad thing in you for the long time it starts to  destroy the other good things in you .
so i am here to talk about it that is mental health or we call it deprassion, axity etc.
so when it start take place in the body nobody knows and  its a very intersting or dangerous thing about it or sometime  its on its high but we not aware about it beacuse of lake of knowldge 
or sometime we denay it beause every one told you that its not any desiese or any problematic thing its only in your mind  but we need to understand that that's not true its a very big 
problem more even it worse than the physical health issue
